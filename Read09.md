# Chapter 7: Forms

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.

In this chapter you will learn:
1. How to create a form on your website 
2. The different tools for collecting data
3. New HTML5 form controls

## Why Forms?
The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.

## Form Controls
There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site.
* ADDING TEXT
* Ma king Choices
* Submitting Forms
* Uploading Files

## How Forms Work
A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.

A form may have several form controls, each
gathering different information. The server
needs to know which piece of inputted data
corresponds with which form element.

## important point that chapter 7 talks about 
* Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
```<form>``` element.
* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

# Chapter 14: Lists, Tables and Forms
There are several CSS properties that
were created to work with specific types
of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,
and forms.

In this chapter you will learn how to:
* Specify the type of bullet p ●● oint or numbering on lists
* Add borders and backgrounds to table cells
* Control the appearance of form controls

## style of lists
* Bullet point styles
* Images for bullets
* Positioning the marker
* List shorthand

## Styling Forms
Nobody I know enjoys filling in forms, so if you can make yours look more attractive and easier to use, more people are likely to fill it in.  lso, when you come to look at a form in a few different  rowsers (as shown on the right), you will see that each  rowser displays them differently.

### most common style 
* Text inputs and text areas
* Submit buttons
* Labels on forms, to get the form controls to align nicely

## important point that chapter 14 talks about 
* In addition to the CSS p XX roperties covered in other
chapters which work with the contents of all elements,
there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms
* List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
