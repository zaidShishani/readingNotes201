# layout 
This part goes on the different ways to position elements using normal flow ,relative positioning,absolute positioning and floats andand how different size and resolution affects the design process and learn the difference between width and liquid layouts and how they are created , and find out how designer use grids to make their page to look more professional 

## key concepts 
CSS trasts HTML elements as boxes the boxes will be either block- level box or inline box 

* block-level elements starts on a new line.

## Page size 

Designer try to create pages around 960-100 pixels since screen size and display resolution vary so much
